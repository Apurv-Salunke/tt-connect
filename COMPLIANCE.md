# License Compliance Guide (AGPL)

This file is a practical checklist for teams using or modifying `tt-connect`.

See also: `DISCLAIMER.md` for financial-risk and liability notices.

## If You Redistribute the Software

1. Keep copyright and license notices.
2. Include a copy/reference of the AGPL license.
3. Provide complete corresponding source code for the distributed version.
4. Document material changes made by your organization.

## If You Run It as a Network Service

Under AGPL, users interacting with the service must be able to obtain source code of the running modified version.

Recommended minimum:

1. Add a visible "Source Code" link in UI/docs/API landing page.
2. Link to exact running source (tag or commit).
3. Publish your patches/fork source for deployed modifications.

## Internal Compliance Controls

1. Track upstream version and local patches.
2. Maintain SBOM/dependency inventory for releases.
3. Add release checklist item for AGPL notice + source availability.
4. Keep legal review for licensing and trademark usage.

## Enforcement Workflow (Project Side)

1. Detect potential non-compliance.
2. Collect dated evidence.
3. Send cure notice with compliance deadline.
4. Escalate via legal channels if unresolved.
